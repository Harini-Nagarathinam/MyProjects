# Sensory Detector of Hazardous Gases
## Industrial Project

### Project Overview
Developed a prototype gas detection system to address ammonia and hydrogen sulphide emissions in poultry farms, which pose risks to both livestock and personnel. The project involved fabricating ZnO thin-film sensors using RF sputtering and photolithography, designing and simulating the amplifier circuit in Proteus and KiCAD, and integrating the system with an STM32 microcontroller. A display module (TM1637) and alarm were added to alert when gas concentration exceeded safe limits.
